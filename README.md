# Apocalyptic

100 years after the humans have made Earth completely uninhabitable from nuclear war, you have been chosen to be sent back down to the surface from the failing space where you were born to see if Earth can once again be populated. The re-entry into the atmosphere didn't go as planned and all of your equipment has been destroyed. Unable to locate any of your comrades you are all alone on the surface of what might be, your death sentence... or at least you think you are alone...
 
This mod pack is set in a desolate world, recovering from a nuclear apocalypse. It has some tech, some magic, and everything else you may need to start over on Earth. Can you survive the extreme darkness and what it brings? Can you re-establish life on Earth? Can you get the message back to space before it is too late for the rest of the Human race? Are you the last one of your kind?
